# Say Hello !


## What will you learn during the tutorial?

Wouldn't be cool to show something on your BBC Micro:bit ?

Like a text...like "Hello YOURNAME, I am your Micro:bit" ?

Let's to this !

** This will be our first program ! **

## How to ask your Micro:bit to say hello

Your Micro:bit can do a lot of things but you need to explain it how to do this.
It's like when you are stading and you are "importing" what you read inside your mind.

So it's time to open **MuEditor** and type this first line:

```python
# This is a COMMENT
from microbit import display
```

now we can ask Micro:bit to display our text

```python
# This is a AGAIN a COMMENT
from microbit import display

display.show("Hello PutYourNameHere, I am your Micro:bit")
```
