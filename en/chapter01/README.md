# Programming & Python

## What will you learn during this chapter ?

* What it means 'programming'
* What can you do today programming
* What is Python

## The art of programming
Probably you have already heard the word 'programming'.

But what does it mean ?

Well, to simplify programming is the art to talk with an electronic device (a computer or a BBC Micro:bit for example)
to tell it do to something.
See the Micro:bit as a best friend and programming like the way to ask him for a favour.

But why we can consider programming like an __art__ ?

* Because it's not just about pressing buttons
* You need to use your brain
* Often you will create something form scratch
* There is not just one way to resolve a problem
* You need to creative and inspired


## What can I do today if I know how to program ?

Well that's really a good question!
If programming is like an art....the only limit is your __imagination__.
If we think about programming like the art of talk to the machines (computers) and let them doing what you want
well you can really create a lot of useful stuff.

Where is the art of programming used ?

* You can play with the Micro:bit
* You can discover the [Gravitational Waves](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/45g8qu/we_are_the_ligo_scientific_collaboration_and_we/ "Gravitational Waves")
* You can send things to the space

## Programming language
Computer can understand only 0 and 1 but we do not.
How can we talk with a computer in a language what we understand ?
That's where programming languages come in.

Programming languages are, generally, easy to read for us and the same time they can be easily translated in 0 and 1.

An example ?

```python
print("Hello ! I am Python")
```
This line would print 'Hello !, I am Python' in your computer.
Nothing complicated !

## What is Python ?
Python is a programming language.
Actually it's pretty old, the first version was released in 1991 and created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum "Guido Van Rossum"). 
Python is free, you don't have to pay for it and is open.
What does it mean ?
Basically it means you can read the code behind "Python"....but well forget about this for now.

But why Python is so special and why are we going to learn it ?

Python is easy to read, use and at the same time really powerful.

You can use Python to create website like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django Web Framework"), create self-driving cares or helping researchers in doing _better_ research.


# Question time!

## Why do you think programming is useful ?

* That's an open question :)

## What is Python ?

1. A form of art
2. A programming language
3. A website
4. A book from Guido Van Rossum

## That's all

Ready for the next chapter ?
