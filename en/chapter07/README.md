## What will you learn during this chapter ?

* Mixing the lectures to create something new!

Form some groups and try to work together, if you need any help don't be afraid to ask!

## Python Programmers
If you need any help don't forget to check the [Micro:bit Micropython docs](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io).


## Quest  n.1 - Display a Christmas Tree
Yeah.... Christmas is over, but a Christmas tree is always nice.
Try to display a Christmas tree on you Micro:bit.

Hints:
* Remember you have to use Image()

## Quest n.2 - Display the button you pressed
The goal of this quest is to write a program that display the name of the button you pressed.

Hints:
* You only have 2 buttons __A__ and __B__
* try to use `if`
* use `is_pressed()`

## Challenge n.3 - 
Probably you have already heard the word 'programming'.

But what does it mean ?

Well, to simplify programming is the art to talk with an electronic device (a computer or a BBC Micro:bit for example)
to tell it do to something.
See the Micro:bit as a best friend and programming like the way to ask him for a favour.

## Quest n.4 - Shack and display messages!
The goal of this quest is to write a program that display different messages everytime you shack you Micro:bit.

Some hints:
* you can put all your messages inside a list
* use `accelerometer.was_gesture("shake")`
* pick a random message using random.choice(messages)

But what does it mean ?
