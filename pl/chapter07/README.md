* How to talk with your Micro:Bit (MuEditor)

## The art of programming
Probably you have already heard the word 'programming'.

But what does it mean ?

Well, to simplify programming is the art to talk with an electronic device (a computer or a BBC Micro:bit for example)
to tell it do to something.
See the Micro:bit as a best friend and programming like the way to ask him for a favour.


## BBC Micro:bit
What is a BBC Micro:bit ?

It should be in your hands already.....is a very tiny device, a small computer.

It has 2 main buttons (A and B), a display formed by 25 red leds (very small lights), a radio module and some sensors, an accelorometer and a compass.

We can use the buttons and the sensors as inputs (input means we give some information to the microbit) and the display to show something like images and text (output).

You can program your Micro:bit connecting it to your computer, it has a micro-usb port, if you plug it you will see leds blinking.
It also has a small connector where you can plug a battery-box, in this way you can give energy to your Micro:bit without a computer.

## Python
Computer can understand only 0 and 1 but we do not.
How can we talk with a computer in a language what we understand ?
That's where Python comes in.

Python is a programming language easy to read for us but can be easlily translated in 0 and 1 (we don't have to worry about this,
Python is going to do this itself).

An example ?

```python
print("Hello ! I am Python")
```
This line would print 'Hello !, I am Python' in your computer.
Nothing complicated !

## Talking with your BBC Micro:bit
So to talk with your BBC Micro:bit you need to talk a language that it can understand: Python.

But where can we write our code ? We can use a text editor for this, **Mu**.
Mu is an editor specifically made to program the BBC Micro:bit.

Let's start Mu
